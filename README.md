## Movie Mania

Movie Mania is an app geared towards Horror movie fans who'd like to view movies of that genre and more information about them. Initially, as you can tell by the wireframes, we intended to simply do recently popular movies but after some deliberation, chose to focus on horror because we thought it would be a killer theme.

## Learning Goals
This project was assigned to give the developer a chance to dive into Redux and continue to craft clean cut React. The developer was to learn how to effectively test Redux as well as continue testing asynchronous fetch calls. Additionally, the developer was given the option to thunks for a more thorough Redux experience.
